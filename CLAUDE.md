## Six Core Hypotheses (Drives All Work)

Every line of code in this project exists to validate one of these hypotheses.

| ID | Hypothesis | Target |
|----|-----------|--------|
| H1 | **Speed**: PI-FNO inference is ≥1000× faster than FDS | <50ms vs FDS minutes |
| H2 | **Accuracy**: Relative L2 ≤ 15% on training scenarios | EXP-FIRE-001 |
| H3 | **Generalization**: PI-FNO outperforms ConvLSTM on OOD scenarios | EXP-FIRE-001 OOD |
| H4 | **Practicality**: Risk map FNR <10% (false negative rate) | EXP-RISK-001 |
| H5 | **Risk map fidelity**: PI-FNO risk map IoU ≥0.7 vs FDS ground truth | EXP-RISK-001 |
| H6 | **Path safety**: Dynamic A* reduces cumulative FED ≥30% vs static | EXP-PATH-001 |

**Presentation emphasis order**: H1 → H6 → H4 → H2 → H5 → H3.

H6 is the strongest card: static-vs-dynamic FED comparison is intuitive,
visually striking, and immediately resonates with fire safety engineering
judges.

## Hard Constraints — NEVER Violate

### Geometry

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Building | Single floor, complex maze layout (multiple rooms, intersections, central courtyard) |
| **Real STL building** | Up to 3.2 m height (preserved as-is in PyroSim) |
| **FDS MESH** (computational domain) | **100 × 80 × 8 cells** over **[−10, 40] × [−10, 30] × [0, 4] m** |
| **SLCF region** (learnable, model-visible) | **60 × 40 × 6 cells** over **[0, 30] × [0, 20] × [0, 3] m** |
| Cell resolution | **0.5 m × 0.5 m × 0.5 m** |
| External buffer | 10 m on −X, +X, −Y, +Y for ventilation boundaries |

**Critical distinction:** The MESH is what FDS simulates (with 10 m buffer).
The SLCF is what models ingest. The buffer exists purely for boundary
conditions and is invisible to ML.

**Real STL height 3.2 m, but SLCF extracts only 0~3 m.** This preserves
the physical building shape while keeping the learnable grid at 6 z-cells
(matching `GRID_SHAPE`). Top 0.2 m is the hottest smoke layer but does not
affect breathing-zone analysis (1.5 m). See decision D-015.

### Time

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Simulation duration | 0–300 s |
| Time steps | **31 frames** at **10 s** intervals |
| FDS `DT_SLCF` | 10.0 |
| Model prediction step | 10 s (single autoregressive step) |
| Predictive horizon | 60 s (6 autoregressive steps) |

### Data

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total scenarios | **30** (24 train / 3 val / 3 OOD) |
| Fire HRR variations | 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 kW |
| Fire location variations | 6 distinct locations across the maze |
| Ventilation | All scenarios: both end doors open (fixed) |
| Single-scenario CPU time | ~23 minutes (validated empirically) |

### Compute

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Training GPU | NVIDIA A100 40 GB on RunPod |
| Coordinate system | Metres, Z-up, world origin at corner (0, 0, 0) |
| Units | **SI only** — m, s, °C, ppm. NEVER mm. |

## Team Roles (Who Does What)

The project is a 4-person team with parallel workstreams.

| Member | Primary responsibility | Modules owned |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| **A** | Building modeling, FDS simulations, scenario design | PyroSim, FDS configs, scenario_config.json |
| **B** | Model training (ConvLSTM, PI-FNO) | `src/models/`, `src/training/` |
| **C** | Data pipeline, dataset, normalization | `src/shared/`, `src/data_pipeline/`, `src/dataset/` |
| **D** | Evaluation, integration, visualization | `src/evaluation/`, `src/integration/`, `src/visualization/`, paper |

Risk map and path planning (Weeks 10–11) are shared by B and C as the
team's joint workload.

**Claude Code is delegated to**: code implementation under all members'
guidance. Claude Code does NOT make scope decisions, hyperparameter
choices, or scientific judgment calls — those go to humans.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Library / Tool |
|-------|---------------|
| Deep learning | Python 3.10+, PyTorch 2.0+, CUDA 11.8+ |
| Neural operator | `neuraloperator` (FNO) |
| FDS data | `fdsreader` |
| Graph / routing | `NetworkX` |
| Interpolation | `scipy.interpolate.RegularGridInterpolator` |
| Drone sim (Wk 12) | `pybullet`, `gym-pybullet-drones` |
| Experiment tracking | Weights & Biases |
| Testing | `pytest` |

---

## Tensor Conventions — CRITICAL

All model code must use these shapes:

```
Model input  : (B, 5, 60, 40, 6)   channels → [T, V, CO, mask, time_enc]
Model output : (B, 3, 60, 40, 6)   channels → [T, V, CO]
```

- All channels normalized to **[0, 1]**
- Convention: **higher value = more dangerous** (channels 0–2)
- Visibility is **INVERSE-mapped**: low visibility → high value
- Time encoding broadcast spatially (constant across grid for each frame)

Single-timestep usage: input is one frame, output is one frame at t+10s.
For 60s horizon, autoregress 6 times (chain output → input).

See `docs/interface_contracts.md` for exact normalisation formulas.

---

## RiskMap Interface (CRITICAL)

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import numpy as np

class RiskMap(ABC):
    """Abstract risk map.

    Three concrete implementations live in src/risk_map/.
    Both data_pipeline (validation) and PyBullet integration use this same
    query() interface. Code that consumes risk maps does not need to know
    which implementation is in use.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def query(
        self,
        xyz: np.ndarray,           # shape (3,) or (N, 3) in world metres
        t: float | None = None,    # simulation time in seconds
    ) -> float | np.ndarray:
        """Returns danger ∈ [0, 1].

        Out-of-bounds → 1.0  (safety default — drone going outside building
                              should be flagged dangerous).
        Out-of-time-range → 1.0
        """
```

Three concrete implementations:

| Class | Used by | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `FDSRiskMap` | data_pipeline, validation | Ground truth from FDS data |
| `FNORiskMap` | evaluation | PI-FNO inference results |
| `DynamicRiskMap` | PyBullet demo (Week 12) | Time-evolving live map |

---

## Tenability Thresholds (ISO 13571 + SFPE Handbook)

| Indicator | Safe | Danger |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Temperature | 30 °C | 60 °C (humid air) |
| Visibility | 10 m | 3 m |
| CO instantaneous | 100 ppm | 1400 ppm |
| FED (CO cumulative) | — | 0.3 (sensitive population) |

Sources: ISO 13571:2012 §5–7; SFPE Handbook 5th Ed. Ch. 63 (Purser & McAllister 2016).
See `docs/risk_indicators.md` for full derivation and Korean glossary.

---

## What This Project Does NOT Do

Do **not** add these features, even if they seem natural extensions.
Each was explicitly excluded for scope or feasibility reasons (see
`docs/decisions.md` for rationales):

- Multi-floor buildings (single floor only)
- Real-time CFD (FDS pre-computed only)
- Mesh resolution other than 0.5 m
- Drone swarms (single Crazyflie sim)
- Real fire experiments (simulation only)
- Ventilation variation (all scenarios: both doors open)
- HCN, irritant gas, or radiant heat FED (CO only)
- Real human behaviour modelling (idealised evacuees)
- Replacing existing fire safety systems (we are auxiliary)

---

## FDS Input File Conventions — LESSONS LEARNED

These rules have been validated by trial and error. Violating them breaks
the data pipeline:

1. **NEVER set `VECTOR=.TRUE.` on `&SLCF`.**
   Combination of `VECTOR=.TRUE.` and `CELL_CENTERED=.TRUE.` causes
   `fdsreader` to fail with broadcast errors during slice loading.
   Use scalar slices only (3 slices: T, V, CO). See L-001.

2. **SLCF Z range MUST be exactly `0.0, 3.0`** (not 3.2 or 3.5).
   PyroSim may auto-set this to 3.5 to accommodate STL height 3.2 m.
   Manual fix required. See L-009 and D-015.

3. **Always use `CELL_CENTERED=.TRUE.`** for SLCF data we feed into models.

4. **`DT_SLCF=10.0`** to align with model time step.

5. **SLCF `XB` must extract** the learnable region [0, 30] × [0, 20] × [0, 3]
   even when the MESH is larger.

6. Three SLCF only: `TEMPERATURE`, `SOOT VISIBILITY` (or `VISIBILITY`),
   `VOLUME FRACTION` (with `SPEC_ID='CARBON MONOXIDE'`).

Example correct SLCF:
```
&SLCF QUANTITY='TEMPERATURE',
      CELL_CENTERED=.TRUE.,
      ID='Temperature',
      XB=0.0,30.0, 0.0,20.0, 0.0,3.0/
```

Wrong (causes fdsreader failure):
```
&SLCF QUANTITY='TEMPERATURE',
      VECTOR=.TRUE.,            ← REMOVE THIS LINE
      CELL_CENTERED=.TRUE.,
      ID='Temperature',
      XB=0.0,30.0, 0.0,20.0, 0.0,3.5/   ← MUST BE 3.0
```

---

## fdsreader Standard Pattern

This is the canonical way to load FDS data. Use verbatim in any module.

```python
import fdsreader
from pathlib import Path

sim = fdsreader.Simulation(str(Path(fds_dir)))

# Filter by quantity name (matches the SLCF QUANTITY in .fds file)
temp_slc = sim.slices.filter_by_quantity("TEMPERATURE")[0]
vis_slc  = sim.slices.filter_by_quantity("SOOT VISIBILITY")[0]
co_slc   = sim.slices.filter_by_quantity("CARBON MONOXIDE VOLUME FRACTION")[0]

# Returns (T, nx, ny, nz) array AND coordinate dict in world metres
grid, coords = temp_slc.to_global(return_coordinates=True)

# coords['x'] = [0.25, 0.75, ..., 29.75]   ← cell centres in world metres
# Because origin is aligned, these ARE world coordinates. No transformation.
```

For pre-conditions (CELL_CENTERED required, VECTOR forbidden, etc.) see
`docs/coordinate_convention.md`.

## Coding Conventions

### Required for all public code

- **Type hints** on every function signature
- **Docstrings** on every public function (Google or NumPy style)
- **Tensor shapes documented** in docstrings: `Args: x: shape (B, 5, 60, 40, 6)`
- **`pathlib.Path`** for file paths, never `os.path.join`
- **`raise ValueError("clear message")`** — never silent failures
- **`if __name__ == '__main__'`** self-test block in computational modules,
  printing PASS/FAIL clearly
- **Absolute imports**: `from src.shared.constants import GRID_SHAPE`
- **YAML** for config files (loaded via `dataclass` or Pydantic)
- **Korean comments OK**, but identifiers must be English

### Forbidden

- Black/Ruff configuration (skip — keep tooling minimal)
- `from foo import *` (always explicit)
- Configuration as raw dicts in production code (use dataclasses)
- Silent exception handling
- Hard-coded numerical constants (use `src/shared/constants.py`)

### Module structure

Every computational module must have:

1. Module docstring (purpose, author, related week in manual)
2. Imports
3. Type-hinted functions/classes with docstrings
4. `if __name__ == '__main__'` self-test that prints `PASS` or `FAIL`

---

## Three Critical Experiments

The project is structured around three named experiments. Each produces a
clear table for the final paper and presentation.

| Experiment | Compares | Output |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **EXP-FIRE-001** | ConvLSTM vs FNO no-PI vs FNO full | RMSE/SSIM table, OOD generalization |
| **EXP-RISK-001** | FDS ground truth vs PI-FNO predicted risk maps | IoU at 0.3/0.5/0.7, FNR, FPR |
| **EXP-PATH-001** | Dijkstra vs Static avoidance vs Dynamic predictive | Cumulative FED, reach time |

Plus three **ablations** (Week 11):
- PI loss components contribution
- Training data size vs performance curve
- Model size variation (optional)

---

## Plan B — Failure Scenarios

Anticipate these. Each has a documented response in `docs/manual_v2.md`.

| Failure | Response |
|---------|----------|
| FDS scenarios don't finish in Week 5 | Reduce to 20 scenarios, T_END to 180 s |
| PI-FNO doesn't beat ConvLSTM | Refocus paper on "30-scenario regime trade-offs" |
| RunPod cost exceeds budget | Switch to Spot only, drop Ablation 3, drop PyBullet demo |
| Coordinate system bugs | Re-validate via `docs/coordinate_convention.md` checklist |
| Team member overload | Cut PyBullet demo, Ablation 3, Tier 1 GNN; preserve EXP-* |

---

## Workflow Rules

### Module development cycle

1. **Implement** with type hints and docstrings
2. **Self-test** via `__main__` block: `python -m src.module.path`
3. **Human review**: file diff and explanation
4. **Unit test** in `tests/` using pytest
5. **Commit** with clear message

### Decision-making

- **When in doubt about scope, ASK** before expanding
- **Single-purpose functions** — no "while we're at it" features
- **Reference checks before improvement**: confirm interface change is
  necessary before modifying contracts
- **Log major decisions** to `docs/decisions.md` after agreement
- **Log new bugs** to `docs/lessons_learned.md` after fixing

### Communicating with this project

- Read `CLAUDE.md` first (you are doing this now)
- Read explicitly referenced docs as needed
- Never auto-load all docs — preserve context budget
- Follow the 8-section task request template (see `docs/task_request_template.md`)

## Current Project State (Update as You Progress)

**Last data validation**: `0507_v1` simulation has SLCF Z=3.5 issue.
Awaiting re-simulation with SLCF Z=3.0 fix (see L-009).

**Next milestone**: Validate fdsreader on corrected single-scenario data,
then implement `src/data_pipeline/fds_extractor.py` (Week 6 work).

**Active blockers**: None — STL fix and SLCF fix can both proceed in parallel.
